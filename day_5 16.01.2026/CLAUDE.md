# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an experimental repository (Day 5 of "AiWithLoveDay1") focused on testing LLM behavior when system roles change during a conversation. It contains a system prompt design exercise rather than executable code.

## Contents

- **`changing_prompt_during_conversation.md`** - A system prompt experiment that tests role-switching behavior:
  - Phase 1: LLM acts as a mathematician
  - Phase 2: User commands role change to medical doctor
  - Phase 3: LLM provides comparative analysis of how behavior changed between roles
  - Demonstrates how system prompts influence LLM reasoning, vocabulary, and problem-solving approaches
