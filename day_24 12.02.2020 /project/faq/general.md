## Account Creation

To create an account, visit the sign-up page and enter your email address. You will receive a verification email within a few minutes. Click the verification link to activate your account. If you do not receive the email, check your spam folder or request a new verification link.

## Password Reset

To reset your password, click "Forgot Password" on the login page. Enter the email address associated with your account. You will receive a password reset link valid for 24 hours. For security, the link can only be used once. If the link has expired, you can request a new one.

## Plan Tiers
