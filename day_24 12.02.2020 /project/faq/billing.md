# Billing FAQ

## Subscription Management

You can manage your subscription from Settings > Billing. Here you can view your current plan, upcoming invoice, payment history, and update your payment method. Changes to your plan take effect at the start of the next billing cycle unless you are upgrading, in which case the change is immediate.

## Payment Methods

We accept credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) and PayPal. Enterprise customers can also pay by bank transfer or wire. To update your payment method, go to Settings > Billing > Payment Method. Your new payment method will be used for the next billing cycle.

## Invoices

Invoices are generated at the start of each billing cycle and sent to the billing email on file. You can download past invoices from Settings > Billing > Invoice History. If you need a custom invoice with specific details like a PO number or VAT ID, contact our billing support team.

## Refund Policy

We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, contact our support team within 14 days of your initial subscription for a full refund. After the 14-day period, refunds are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Refunds for annual plans are prorated based on the remaining months.

## Double Charges

If you notice a double charge on your statement, please contact our billing team immediately. Double charges are typically resolved within 3-5 business days. You can report a double charge from Settings > Billing > Report an Issue or by contacting support directly.

## Cancellation

You can cancel your subscription at any time from Settings > Billing > Cancel Subscription. After cancellation, you will retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing cycle. Your data will be preserved for 90 days after cancellation in case you decide to resubscribe.

## Tax Information

Prices displayed on our website are exclusive of tax unless otherwise stated. Applicable taxes (VAT, GST, sales tax) will be added during checkout based on your billing address. Enterprise customers in the EU can provide their VAT ID to apply reverse charge.
